HubSpot is now going to be combining stylesheet is order to make fewer requests to help increase website load time. This will be great for customers as load time will be decreased with fewers requests. What will be more difficult is going to be debugging these stylesheets and seeing where the route of the problem is coming from. Luckily a built in feature for HubSpot is to append Query String to the of the URL and this will un-combine the stylesheets so you can see exactly where the CSS is coming from. 

When you click on this Chrome Extension it is going to append a Query String of ?hsDebug=true to the end of the URL in order for you to effectively troubleshoot the CSS that ia on the current webpage.
